# Dead
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 365. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

A dead creature has no [Hit Points](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) and can't regain them unless it is first revived by magic such as the [Raise Dead](z_Resources/CLI/spells/raise-dead-xphb.md) or [Revivify](z_Resources/CLI/spells/revivify-xphb.md) spell. When such a spell is cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can refuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the creature requires calling the spirit back.

If the creature returns to life, the revival effect determines the creature's current [Hit Points](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). Unless otherwise stated, the creature returns to life with any [Condition](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md), magical contagions, or curses that were affecting it at death if the durations of those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died with any [Exhaustion](z_Resources/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) levels, it returns with 1 fewer level. If the creature had [Attunement](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/attunement-xphb.md) to one or more magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.
