# Hit Point Dice
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 368. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

Hit Point Dice, or Hit Dice for short, help determine a [Player Character](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/player-character-xphb.md) Hit Point maximum, as explained in "chapter 2". Most [Monster](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) also have Hit Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during a [Short Rest](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) to regain [Hit Points](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).
