# Instrument of the Bards
*Wondrous item (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](z_Resources/CLI/items/img/instrument-of-the-bards.webp#right)


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the instrument to cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

All Instrument of the Bards can be used to cast the following spells: [Fly](z_Resources/CLI/spells/fly-xphb.md), [Invisibility](z_Resources/CLI/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Levitate](z_Resources/CLI/spells/levitate-xphb.md), [Protection from Evil and Good](z_Resources/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md)
