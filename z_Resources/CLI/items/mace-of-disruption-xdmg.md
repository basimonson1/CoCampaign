# Mace of Disruption
*Weapon ([mace](z_Resources/CLI/items/mace-xphb.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](z_Resources/CLI/items/img/mace-of-disruption.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra `2d6` Radiant damage. If the target has 25 [Hit Points](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has the [Frightened](z_Resources/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition until the end of your next turn.

## Light

While you hold this weapon, it sheds [Bright Light](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet.
