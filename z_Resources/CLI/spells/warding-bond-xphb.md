# Warding Bond
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, a pair of platinum rings worth 50+ GP each, which you and the target must wear for the duration
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has [Resistance](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 [Hit Points](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.

**Classes**: [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb)
