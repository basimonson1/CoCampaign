Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) and also regain `2d8` [Hit Points](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a [Long Rest](z_Resources/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
