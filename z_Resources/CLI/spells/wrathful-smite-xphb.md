# Wrathful Smite
*1st-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V

The target takes an extra `1d6` Necrotic damage from the attack, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](z_Resources/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the [Frightened](z_Resources/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin); [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin)
